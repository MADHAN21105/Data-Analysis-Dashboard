# üìà Conclusions & Insights

### ‚úÖ Premium Pricing Trends:

   Urban policyholders tend to pay higher premiums compared to rural customers.
  
  Full coverage policies dominate over liability-only plans.

   Majority of claims fall under the low severity category.

   High-severity claims are minimal but could lead to higher premium adjustments.

### ‚úÖ Customer Journey Insights:

  Only ~11% of website visitors convert into quotes.
  
  Further drop-off from inquiries to final purchases, indicating potential friction in the buying process.
